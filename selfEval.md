Pretty confident.

I could still continue to put in practice to feel more confident and fluent in creating the if statements.

It took longer than I anticipated and a couple cups of coffee late at night.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Putting all this lesson in practice would be very helpful, mostly on if statements with logical operators.

I tend to struggle on overthinking on the formatting of the prompts and analyze how I could maybe misinterpret the prompt.
